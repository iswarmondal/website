## Abstract

This is a very dear personal project of mine which is inspired by the popular video calling website [Omegle](https://omegle.com) which has been shutdown for a while now.

Here I explored technologies like WebRTC and WebSocket. Also added firebase for quick and easy auth, that just works.

## Introduction

### Motivation
As a yong collage student, I always used to go to Omegle with my friend to just chill and chat with strangers. 
Later, I came to know that technologies like WebRTC exist which can easily facilitate the video calling aspect of such a website.

It's safe to say, I always waned to build such a website which actually works. But never had the time or energy to build on myself.

Currently, got inspired and got started building this. And here we are talking about the end product.

### Personal Goals
- The most important goal was to learn about WebRTC and how it works.
- Building a vintage style UI which mimics the old CTR TV aesthetic.
- Learn more about websockets specially SocketIO.
- Manage the deployment and hosting of the server on my own.
- Wanted to test new Svelte 5

## Design Philosophy

### Visual Inspiration
The design draws inspiration from:
- Late 90s and early 2000s CTR TV aesthetic
- Classic Windows 95 style UI elements
- Some funky yet subtle animations
- Some neon style colors
- Responsive web design which works well on a phone

### Key Design Elements
1. **CTR-like background animations**
   - Used a combination of multiple css animations
   - This gave a flickering CTR like background
   - Added CTR like rendering lines
   - Overall lite and aesthetic look

2. **Windows95-like UI elements**
   - The buttons the sections are with sharp corners
   - The colors are mainly teal with some neon accents
   - Overall responsiveness on mobile screens

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Start of the show**: WebRTC
- **Frontend Framework**: Sveltekit with TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Initially build with Deno, later moved to NodeJS.
- **WebSocket**: SocketIO
- **Programming language**: Typescript (backend and frontend)
- **User auth**: Firebase auth
- **Deployment**: Frontend is deployed on Firebase. The backend is hosted on my own VPS.

### Key Features
1. **Video calling without a server**
   - Direct peer-2-peer video chat with minimal latency
   - Quick paring between 2 users thanks to websockets
   - No bots, thanks to firebase auth.
   - Privacy, as the video packets do not go though the server.

2. **Design**
   - Vintage CTR TV aesthetic
   - Windows95 like UI elements
   - Responsive design

## Learning Outcomes

### Technical Skills
1. **WebRTC**
   - Got to learn how WebRTC works
   - What are ICE servers and why are they useful
   - Learnt a lot while working with Audio-Video streams

2. **Signaling server (NodeJS)**
   - Dove deeper into websockets and SocketIO
   - How to make WebSocket connections private
   - Usage of firebase admin with websockets

3. **Deno**
    - How top level Typescript works in Deno
    - How to use NPM packages in Deno
    - How to compile Deno code into executable
    - Handling socket server in Deno
    - Had fun with Deno

4. **New Svelte 5 runes**
    - The syntax difference of svelte runes
    - Working with useEffect and state managements
    - Fallen in love with Svelte, again

5. **Handling DNS records**
    - Learnt how to setup sub-domains
    - How to connect a cloudflare tunnel to a Domain
    - Gained a lot more info about DNS and how a domain works

### Personal Growth
- Learnt a lot on using AI tools for better developer productivity
- Finally, got to deploy my backend to my own VPS.
- Learnt a lot about setting up firewalls and restricting access for server safety.
- How to use Cloudflare proxy and tunnel 

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Working video calling using WebRTC**
   - Completed a working version of the video calling feature of WebRTC

2. **Design Additions**
   - Vintage style design, full mobile responsiveness, fast webapp 

## Reflection

### Successes
- Excellent video calling with near zero latency
- Maintained modern functionality like Google auth and websockets
- Achieved desired vintage aesthetic
- Managing security and privacy successfully

### Learning Points
- WebRTC
- Balance of style and function
- Value of design research
- Security and privacy of user data

## Conclusion

This project successfully combines vintage design aesthetics with modern web technologies, creating a unique and welcoming video chatting platform.

It serves as both a practical learning experience and a showcase of my ability to learn things fast and implement them quick.

# About this project

- This is my own personal website build with Astro.
- Here I will write about my own projects using the case study feature and thoughts using the blog feature.
- I will also use this website as a live resume which showcases all my skills and experiences at one place.

# Design philosophy and technical details

- The frontend is implemented in the `src` folder. This is a Astro app which is using the Astro blog template.
- This app is designed with a retro newspaper style grainy texture to give a unique look with a bit of modern colors.
- I tried my best to ship zero JS to the client. Making the app performant and fast scoring 100 on Google Lighthouse.
- The content management is done using the Astro's markdown file based content management system. The content lies in the `content` folder in markdown format.
- I am not using any tailwindcss for this project. In fact each component is hand-coded and styled. And there are some global styles declared in the `src/styles/global.css` file.
- The app is hosted on Vercel.
